* http://xkcd.com/1080/ Fun illustration of visual field and idiosyncrasies of the retina. Although note that the cartoonist omitted or got wrong:
    + Spatial scaling into periphery for night vision
    + S-cone, rod scotomas omitted
    + Blood vessels omitted
    + Macular pigment omitted (you don't need to know about that)
    + Chromatic aberration omitted (you don't need to know about that)

## Spatial resolution

* Humans have large individual differences in various visual abilities, e.g. [face recognition](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/22/londons-super-recognizer-police-force?mbid=social_twitter)

* "Testing visual acuity", a rough draft article written by Alex and posted in eLearning in his lectures folder
* VSauce's [The Resolution of the Eye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I5Q3UXkGd0&t=330s). The only mistake I've noticed in this is him speaking as if viewing distance doesn't matter for the calculation of how many pixels are needed.

* Most videos and writing you'll find on the internet are very confused about temporal resolution. An example is [Vsauce in his 'What is video?' video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_2389778551&feature=iv&src_vid=4I5Q3UXkGd0&v=buSaywCF6E8). Considering the errors can help you understand the subtleties: 
    + "How fast does information travel from our eye to the brain?" <- that sounds like latency, but by frame rate he should be talking about rate, not latency.
    + He says: Because our brain holds information for 1/15th of a second, 15 fps will look nice and fluid. That doesn't follow, instead you'd expect to see sudden steps every 1/15th of a second. You wouldn't see any *gaps* because the brain would continue to show the last frame until the next frame, but it should still look stuttery.
    + "If frame rates get higher and higher, you end up with an image that can actually cause headaches when you watch it on a screen". I can't see how that can be true, and his explanation of it doesn't make sense. The brain doesn't "add in motion blur" to make things easier for you. Rather, motion blur is an automatic consequence of the photoreceptors recording the amount of light over an extended interval.
